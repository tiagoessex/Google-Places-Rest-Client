# Example - get 10 sushi restaurants and tascas in a 500m radius from (41.146057,-8.605268)

```python


import googleplaces

try:
	a = googleplaces.getAllPlaces(
			key = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', 
			latitude = 41.146057, 
			longitude = -8.605268, 
			radius = 500, 
			type='restaurant',
			keywords=['sushi','tasca'],
			total = 10)

	for i in a:
		print (i)
		print ("\n\n")

except Exception as e:
	print (str(e))


```

# Notes: 
* Only uses **Google** services.
* **Each API call cost 0.032 USD --- USE THIS SERVICE VERY CAREFULLY**.
* MÃ¡x number of returned places per API call: 20
* If total > 20, then there's going to be a 2 seconds delay, for each API call. If not, a **INVALID_REQUEST** would be throwed.
* Set type to None or '', to retrieve any type
